# node_api
This is part of my thesis work. This is just a testing platform.
But you can clone this repository and strip down the code to your needs.

## Setup
You can setup this nodejs api with the following steps
1. Clone repository
2. npm init
3. npm install
4. create .env file with SQL variables.
  HOST=""
  PORT=number
  USER=""
  PASSWORD=""
  DATABASE=""
5. Run with command npm run devStart 


### Disclaimer
Please notice that the authentication is **not secure**. Password is **not encrypted**. The sql connection just compares table value to given parameters.
This is just for quick base to get things started :)

Parts of this code is copied from tutorials all around internet.
